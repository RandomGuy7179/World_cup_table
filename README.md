## Introduction
The goal of this project was to extract statistics on the performance of all the 79 teams that have participated in the world cup from its inception in 1930 to 2018. The data I wanted was extracted from a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=results.csv) that contains the result data of over 40,000 official national team matches from 1873 to 2022. Using SQL, I queried the dataset and ended up with a table of 79 rows for every team that has played at the world cup. Using this new table, I used Tableau to create a dashboard that visually showcases the data from the table.
